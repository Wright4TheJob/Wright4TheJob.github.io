Hello, and thanks for visiting!

I'd love to accelerate bringing your idea into reality. I'm currently accepting new clients! I'm happy to work on proprietary or open-source projects. For enquiries, reach out to hello@sapling-tech.com and I'll be in touch!
## Who I am
My name is David Wright, and I embody my name's meaning: a maker of all sorts of things, with a love for open source solutions. I have PhD and Masters degrees in mechanical engineering.

My approach to design is a solarpunk one: abundance-oriented, freedom-first, and striving to combine the best of natural and tech solutions for human flourishing. I'm self-motivated and approach problems creatively across the whole range of scales, from parts to systems.

I have worked in the oil and gas industry for four years, and the data center industry for two years, but my longest-running development project started eight years ago with a napkin sketch. I love sticking with a project to see it pushed out into the world, and have the patience and determination to see projects through. I'm experienced in both collaborative and solo remote work and in both traditional and start-up company cultures.

I'm particularly skilled at bridging the gap between practical and academic engineering, team management, and intercultural exchange. I've worked on hands-on engineering projects in eight countries, including in the areas of green energy, fossil fuels, agriculture, education, and social engineering for the economic advancement of underserved communities. Some of these job sites included five or more languages and cultures blending in one project.

My pro-bono projects have included:
- Mentoring children and teens in STEM
- Community oriented transportation access
- Indigenous- and black-lead agricultural equity
- Engineering for mobility and developmental support for children with disabilities
- Computer networking systems for women and girls in STEM in central America
- Community-lead medical and harm reduction development
- Sustainable and accessible housing advocacy
- Many impromptu physics lectures
- Lead teams of students on sustainable engineering projects for needy and emerging areas

My first interview question for you is: How will your idea bring more abundance into the world? Answer in an email to hello@sapling-tech.com
## What I offer
Short version: I'm quite familiar with how to make things out of stuff, and I can do that for you, no matter what thing, no matter what stuff.

Long version:
Mechanical design:
- Elegant and efficient mechanical parts
- Automation and motion design
- Stress analysis and experimental validation
- Resilient CAD and shop-ready mechanical drawings (Solidworks, FreeCAD, or whatever software you use now)
- Design for manufacturing. Especially familiar with CNC machining, sheet metal, welding, and additive manufacturing
Electrical design:
- Low-speed digital design
- Sensor integration
- Microcontroller and micro-computer-based automation control
- SMT PCB design
Software development:
- CLI- and GUI-based desktop application development in Rust and Python
- Mobile app development
- Service integration via API calls with Rust and Python
- Microcontroller firmware development
Product development:
- Requirements definition
- Project management
- Vendor and manufacturer coordination
- Part sourcing and multi-sourcing
- Rapid prototyping cycles
	- In house
		- 3D printing (FDM) with engineering plastics
		- Circuit board assembly (SMT soldering)
		- CNC sheet wood and plastic cutting
